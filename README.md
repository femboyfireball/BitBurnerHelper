# BitBurner Helper
A quick script for automatically pulling, building, and starting an external editor tool and the web dev version of BitBurner

## Requirements
npm and Git


# KNOWN ISSUES
* When closing via ctrl+c, it takes two ctrl+c's to fully close BitBurner. [UNKNOWN SOLUTION]
* Line 99 of the script is unsecure. Yes, I know `source` is insecure, but I don't know a better way to do config files. [UNKNOWN SOLUTION]

# TODO
* Powershell version for Windows users
